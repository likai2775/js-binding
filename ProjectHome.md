Small javascript library to facilitate data binding in web applications.  This currently offers two bits of functionality.  The first is a simple object wrapper for setting and getting object properties based on property paths including paths to nested objects/properties and arrays.  The 2nd builds upon this to provide a simple API for binding javascript objects to/from HTML forms (type conversion too.)


This is still work-in-progress, and feedback and contributions are welcome.
